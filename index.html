On December 18, 2022, South Korean media outlet Dispatch released a dossier on the subject, including texts alleged to be between Chuu and members of BlockBerryCreative staff, as well as details about her exclusive contract.

                On August 4, Chuu revealed that she will release her lightstick named Kkuka.

                <strong>On August 17, Chuu won her lawsuit against BlockBerryCreative. BlockBerryCreative eventually appealed the decision.</strong>
